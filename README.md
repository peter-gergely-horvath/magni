# Magni #

Magni is an open source project aimed at collecting various reusable Java components that simplify development
or address specific needs I have came across.

Some of the solutions here have been based on codes I developed during my work, while other ones would have made 
my life easier when I could not find any out-of-the-box solution for the purpose.

## Featues ##

  * [Collection Utilities](CollectionUtilities.md)
  * [Thread-safe lazy initialization support](ThreadSafeLazyInitialization.md)
  * [Lazy-initialization proxy](LazyInitializationProxy.md)
